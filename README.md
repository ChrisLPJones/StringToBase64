# Base64 Encoding in C

This repository contains a C program that converts ASCII input into Base64 encoding. The program demonstrates various aspects of string manipulation, binary conversion, and memory management in C. It is a comprehensive example of working with command-line arguments, dynamic memory allocation, and data transformation.

## Features
- Handles input from both command-line arguments and standard input.
- Converts ASCII characters to their binary representation.
- Groups binary data into 6-bit chunks and maps them to Base64 characters using a predefined Base64 encoding table.
- Ensures proper padding and alignment for Base64 output.
- Includes custom implementations for cross-platform compatibility (`strcpy_s` for non-Windows platforms).
- Contains detailed comments to explain each step of the process.

## Use Cases
- Learn and practice binary and Base64 encoding techniques in C.
- Understand the handling of dynamic memory allocation and error checking in C programs.
- Explore cross-platform coding practices.
